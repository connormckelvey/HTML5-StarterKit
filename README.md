#HTML5 StarterKit

HTML5 StarterKit is a base system for developing websites in HTML5. It includes elements from HTML5 Boiler Plate, HTML5 Reset, Jen Simmons' Design Starter Kit, and my own customizations

This is is what I use day-to-day for personal use so it is faily customized for my unique needs.
